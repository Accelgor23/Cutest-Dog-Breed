            <p ><br>ALL DOGS ARE CUTE!! Dog and other "pets" are not pets. We as humans include them as part of family.
                If so, we should consider them as part of the family. </p>

            <div class = "center">
            <p><br> However, there are some dog breeds that actually stands out for
                being the most cutest in the world!<br> In general, Golden Retreivers are NOT the most cutest dog breed in the world. YEAH Yeah... But I'm serious on this one though.
                <br>Golden Retrievers are my favorite Dog breed in the world because of their adorable face and fur. <br>It is also worth mentioning that Golden Retrievers are often 
                service animals due to their friendly personality and intelligence.<br> They are often the best choice for being a service animal to be smart enough to understand the training but not smart (dumb)<br> enough to lose focuse during their time of service. Worst case scenario is a Service Dog to be wandering around and ignoring the owner.
